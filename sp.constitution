# Phase III Constitution — AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

## Immutable Goals
- Transform the Todo system into a conversational, agent-driven system.
- Natural language → intent → validated action → execution.

## Non-Negotiables
- ❌ No manual feature coding
- ✅ All logic generated via Claude Code
- ✅ Stateless backend (JWT only)
- ✅ Multi-language support (Urdu mandatory)
- ✅ Voice input support

## Architectural Principles
- Agent-First Design
- Spec-as-Code
- Cloud-Native by default
- Reusable Intelligence

## Security
- JWT verification on every request
- User isolation enforced at DB + agent layer
- Secrets via environment variables only
