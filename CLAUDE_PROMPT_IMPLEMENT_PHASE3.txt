You are Claude Code, an expert spec-driven code generator. Implement Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot.
Read CLAUDE.md and specs/ in the repo. Generate file-by-file outputs and a JSON manifest.

Requirements:
- Agent orchestration endpoints (backend/app/api/agent.py)
- Skills and subagents (skills/*.yaml)
- Chat UI (frontend/app/chat, components)
- VoiceControl component (frontend/components/VoiceControl.js)
- Urdu support (frontend/i18n/ur.json + translator-urdu subagent)
- JWT auth verification middleware in backend (backend/app/auth.py)
- Tests for agent endpoint and auth (backend/tests/)

Output format: For each file, print a delimiter with the path and then contents. Also produce a JSON manifest at start listing all files.
